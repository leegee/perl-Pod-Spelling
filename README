README FOR THE Pod-Spelling DISTRIBUTION

This package contains a number of modules for spell-checking POD
using either Lingua::Ispell or Text::Aspell. One of those modules
must be installed on your system, with their binaries, unless you
plan to use the API to provide your own spell-checker.

INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
